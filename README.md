# Introduction 
This is a Data Profiling Tool develoepd in Python it currently only works with files stored in Azure Data V2 with the heirarchial option turned on.

### Notes

This takes advantage of the excellent profiling tool - pandas-profiling.  Create a storage account and specify V2 with a heirarchial file system.  Generate a SAS token and select the file that requires profiling.
